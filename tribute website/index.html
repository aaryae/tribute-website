            <p>Kobe Bryant spent his early years in Italy and joined the NBA straight out of high school. A dominant scorer,
                Bryant won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. Although later seasons
                were marred by injuries, he surpassed Michael Jordan for third place on the NBA all-time scoring list in
                December 2014 and retired in 2016 after scoring 60 points in his final game.
                <br>
                Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Named after a city in Japan,
                Bryant is the son of former NBA player Joe "Jellybean" Bryant.<br>
                In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the
                youngest All-Star in NBA history at 19. The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille
                O'Neal to win three consecutive NBA championships and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. He also
                inked multi-year endorsement deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.<br>

                Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points
                against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark in NBA history, and led the
                league in scoring that year and the next.
    
                In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to
                the Boston Celtics. In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship.
                Shortly afterward, Bryant was part of the memorial service to honor friend and music superstar Michael
                Jackson. The following year, the Lakers won their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.
                On January 26, 2020, Bryant was onboard a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter that crashed in the Los Angeles suburb of
                Calabasas. Nine people, including Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna "Gigi," died. The helicopter
                was on its way from Orange County to Thousands Oaks, California where Bryant was scheduled to coach a
                tournament game at Mamba Sports Academy.
